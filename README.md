# Online strore (Ruby on Rails + React)

This project is an online store that utilizes Ruby on Rails to create an API and React for the frontend. 

It allows users to register, login, and logout, edit their own information, search for products, view, add to cart, 
create and review their orders.

Additionally, it features an administrator role, granting privileges to add, edit, and delete products, 
view all users, edit their information, and delete them as well.
